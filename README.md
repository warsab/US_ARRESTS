# US_ARRESTS 1979 [PCA]
#### &#10148; Data Set Summary:
`This dataset is a collection of statistical data containing arrests made in 1973 within  US States. The fields contain arrests based off murder, assualt and rape. This data is per 100,000 arrests.ðŸŒ¿`  

## Project Scope & Objective:
#### &#10064;Objective: 
> Exploring data taken from a survey of all the arrests that were done in US states. The arrestes are focused on the features: Rape, Murder and Assualts. In this exploration I will performing 3 things:  
- Analyzing what states have higher features than others, and to which feature is the most common.  

- Will be performing PCA analysis on the dataset to figure out what the princile components that best differentiate the observations by determining the directions along which the data points are most spread out. Since this will be using unsupervised learning, I will not be looking at a specific target, but rather allowing the models to observe the outcomes for me.  

- Lastly will be looking at clustering these features to make further observations.
